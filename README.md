# Stepik-Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics algorithms to answer questions from the course on Bioinformatics on an interactive book on Stepik corresponding to the book "Bioinformatics Algorithms" which can be found at www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org. 
I mainly keep them here for documentation, but they could potentially help other students as well.
